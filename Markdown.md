Week 1: Foundation & Core Processing(I selected them according to grouped functionality)
| Person 	 | Component			 | Justification 
| Dilis 	 | Order Management		 | Central trigger for downstream processes like inventory, production, and logistics. 
| Patrick 	 | Inventory & Procurement	 | Supports real-time availability checks during order creation.  
| Abigaba	 | Production Management 	 | Depends on orders and inventory. Build workflows, schedules, batch tracking. 
| Kristiana	 | Distribution & Logistics	 | Aligns closely with production outputs and order fulfillment.  


By end of next week , we can test the full operational flow: order → stock → production → distribution.



Week 2: Oversight, Support & Control
| Person 	| Component 			                                       
| Dilis		| Quality Control 		                         
| Patrick 	| Chat Service  & (Notifications & Alerts)                   	
| Abigaba 	| Production Coordinator                             
| Kristiana 	| Workforce Allocator & (Notifications & Alerts)            		

Week 2 is built to plug into Week 1’s outputs. Ideal for testing controls, visibility, and access flows.
