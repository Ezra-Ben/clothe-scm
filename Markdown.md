Week 1: Foundation & Core Processing(I selected them according to grouped functionality)
| Person 	 | Component			 | Justification 
| Dilis 	 | Order Management		 | Central trigger for downstream processes like inventory, production, and logistics. 
| Patrick 	 | Inventory & Procurement	 | Supports real-time availability checks during order creation.  
| Abigaba	 | Production Management 	 | Depends on orders and inventory. Build workflows, schedules, batch tracking. 
| Kristiana	 | Distribution & Logistics	 | Aligns closely with production outputs and order fulfillment.  


By end of next week , we can test the full operational flow: order → stock → production → distribution.



Week 2: Oversight, Support & Control
| Person 	| Component 			| Justification 
| Dilis		| Quality Control 		| Hooks into production, allowing checks and traceability testing. 
| Patrick 	| Reporting & Analytics		| Requires data from Week 1 components. Build dashboards, KPIs, usage trends.  
| Abigaba 	| User Auth & Access Management | Set permissions for each module; essential before going live.  
| Kristiana 	| ML Models & Insights 		| Trains on production and distribution data; finalize data flow and endpoints. 


Week 2 is built to plug into Week 1’s outputs. Ideal for testing controls, visibility, and access flows.



SIMPLE SCENARIO UNDERSTANDING AND RANDOM TESTS(A FEW OF THE MANY YOU ARE TO DO)

Week 1 Integration Checkpoints
1. Order Management → Inventory
Checkpoint: When a new order is placed
Expected Behavior:
- Trigger real-time stock check
- Reserve available items (soft lock)
- Return availability confirmation with a fulfillment flag
Scenario Test:
- Place order with limited stock → expect partial confirmation
- Simultaneous orders → ensure race conditions don't cause double booking

2. Inventory → Production
Checkpoint: When order is confirmed and stock is available
Expected Behavior:
- Auto-initiate production task queue
- Assign raw materials from inventory
- Create production schedule entry
Scenario Test:
- Simulate material shortage → expect backorder flag
- Item with multiple dependencies → validate BOM (Bill of Materials) logic

3. Production → Logistics
Checkpoint: Upon completion of a production batch
Expected Behavior:
- Notify logistics module of items ready for delivery
- Assign packaging and routing instructions
Scenario Test:
- Multiple batches ready → ensure FIFO (first-in, first-out) routing
- Urgent orders → test express handling logic

Week 2 Integration Checkpoints
4. Production → Quality Control
Checkpoint: Before marking production as “completed”
Expected Behavior:
- QC form attached to each batch
- Metrics captured: defects, tester ID, timestamps
Scenario Test:
- Introduce a defect report → ensure batch blocked from logistics
- Re-test scenario → validate retry logic for cleared batches

5. Logistics → Dashboard & Analytics
Checkpoint: On shipment dispatch and delivery confirmation
Expected Behavior:
- Trigger event to analytics: "shipment.sent" and "shipment.delivered"
- Dashboards update average fulfillment time, delivery delays
Scenario Test:
- Delayed shipment → validate anomaly detection flags
- Late-night delivery → validate time zone processing and logs

6. Order Management → Auth / Access Control
Checkpoint: When users log in or attempt to access orders
Expected Behavior:
- Validate role: supplier can only see their own orders
- Admins can filter, override, or assign roles
Scenario Test:
- Cross-user access attempt → return 403
- Change user role mid-session → validate immediate permission update

7. Analytics / Reporting → ML & Insights
Checkpoint: Once enough production and delivery data is collected
Expected Behavior:
- Generate predictive metrics (e.g., production delays, demand surges)
- ML suggests resupply or reallocation strategies
Scenario Test:
- Feed synthetic demand spike → expect elevated forecast
- Check insight response time under high traffic or data load

Bonus Sync Points
- Event bus or Laravel Events can ensure real-time updates between modules.
- Jobs & Queues for async tasks like reporting, notifications, ML pipelines.
- Feature flags if you want to isolate partially completed components for safer testing.
